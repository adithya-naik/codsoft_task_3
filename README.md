# Password Generator - TASK 3

The **Password Generator** creates strong and random passwords based on user specifications. Users can specify the desired password length and complexity. Here's how it works:

1. **User Input:**
   - The user is prompted to specify the desired length of the password.
   - For example, the user might input a length of 12 characters.

2. **Generate Password:**
   - The application generates a password by combining random characters.
   - The characters can include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols.
   - The complexity of the password depends on the user's preferences.
   - For example, a generated password might look like: `R7#kT9p$JfXz`

3. **Display the Password:**
   - The generated password is displayed on the screen.
   - Users can then use this strong password for their accounts, ensuring better security.
